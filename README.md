# Algorithm/SQL Problem Solving

 This repository contains the solutions to various algorithm problems. The goal is to record the algorithms used and the problem-solving approaches, making it easy to review and improve upon them.

## üìù Introduction

 This repository is dedicated to recording algorithm problem solutions from various platforms such as **Baekjoon**, **Programmers**, **LeetCode**, etc. The focus is on **practicing algorithms** and **documenting** the problem-solving processes to refer back to when needed.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

 The problems are organized by platform, and each problem is grouped into folders by **month and year** for easy reference.
